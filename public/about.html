<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ron Dexter Uy and I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently taking the web developer course on Udemy, conducted by Dr. Angela Yu. After this course, I am hoping that I will be able to land a developer job.
</p>

<p>I was born October 24, 1988 in Davao City Philippines. I am currently married with 3 kids, who are my inspiration to strive hard.
  I previously studied Computer Science in one of the big universities here in the Philippines, so taking this web developer course 
  won't be too hard for me as I am familiar with the terms.
</p>

<p>I started by professional career back in 2010, as a call center agent across 3 companies. In between my jobs, I also did some freelancing,
  doing various online freelance jobs, doing short-term contracts. In 2016, I have fully transitioned to a online remote, working as an email and chat support
  for an online video animation company. I also worked a similar role for a podcasting company for a year, as a part-time job.
